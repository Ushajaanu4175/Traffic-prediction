ðŸš¦ Traffic Flow Prediction Using TemporalCNN
Traffic congestion is a major urban challenge, leading to delays, fuel wastage, and pollution. This project aims to predict future traffic volume using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), helping in traffic management, route planning, and congestion control. The dataset used (data/traffic_volume_data.csv) contains historical traffic records, including timestamps, traffic volume, weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind speed), and road features (lane count, congestion level).

Before training the model, data preprocessing is performed to handle missing values, scale features, and convert the dataset into PyTorch tensors. The TCN model architecture consists of 1D convolutional layers to learn temporal dependencies, causal and dilated convolutions to ensure predictions rely only on past data, and residual connections to improve gradient flow. The model is implemented in temporal_cnn_model.py and trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, Adam optimizer (learning rate = 0.0015), with a batch size of 512 for 100 epochs. The key evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.

Once trained, the model is tested using test_model.py, where it loads the trained model (models/trained_model.pth), preprocesses test data, makes predictions, and plots results comparing predicted vs. actual traffic volume. The model achieves MAE = 583.38, RMSE = 713.12, and RÂ² Score = 0.84, indicating strong predictive performance. The predictions closely align with actual traffic trends, making the model highly reliable for traffic forecasting.

Overall, this project demonstrates how TemporalCNN can effectively predict traffic flow, contributing to improved urban mobility. The results show great potential for real-world applications, such as reducing congestion, optimizing traffic systems, and enhancing city planning.
